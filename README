== About Helpdeck

Helpdeck is a social Q&A forum integrated on twitter API. I developed this project to learn more about Ruby on Rails, oauth and the twitter API. And I wanted to learn all this stuff because Rails rocks and I wanted to be a Ruby on Rails developer. Well, i did it and now I'm a Web Developer at <http://busk.com>!

Helpdeck is powered by:

* Heroku <http://heroku.com>
* Ruby On Rails 3.0 <http://rubyonrails.com>
* Omniauth <https://github.com/intridea/omniauth>
* Jammit <https://github.com/documentcloud/jammit>
* Twitter <https://github.com/jnunemaker/twitter>
* 52Framework <http://www.52framework.com/>
* HTML5 <http://www.w3schools.com/html5/html5_reference.asp>
* CSS3 <http://www.w3schools.com/css3/>

If your like me and want to learn a more about those technologies fell free to study the code and contribute to it. But if you want to create an awesome commercial product on top of it please talk to me first.
